An Ark client is a software that allows users to interact with the Ark Service Provider. It can be a CLI, a Progressive Web Application or native app for desktop and mobile. 

The Ark client is responsible for creating wallets, sending and receiving payments, and managing the user's funds. It communicates with the Ark Service Provider to perform these actions off-chain.
